                <h3>Prerequisite: Python</h3>
                <p>While Jupyter runs code in many programming languages, <strong>Python</strong> is a requirement 
                   (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the Jupyter Notebook itself.
                </p>
                <h3>Installing Jupyter using Anaconda</h3>
                <p>We <strong>strongly recommend</strong> installing Python and Jupyter using the <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda Distribution</a>,
                   which includes Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.
                </p>
                <p>First, download <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a>. We recommend downloading Anaconda’s latest Python 3 version.</p>
                <p>Second, install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following the instructions on the download page.</p>

                <p>Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook! To run the notebook, run the following command at 
                   the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows): {% highlight bash %}jupyter notebook{% endhighlight %}
                <p>
                <p>See <a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running">Running the Notebook</a> for more details.</p>

                <h3>Installing Jupyter with pip</h3>
                <p>As an existing or experienced Python user, you may wish to install Jupyter using Python’s package manager, 
                    <a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-pip">pip</a>, instead of Anaconda.
                </p>
                <p>First, ensure that you have the latest pip; older versions may have trouble with some dependencies:</p>
                {% highlight bash %}pip3 install --upgrade pip{% endhighlight %}
                <p>Then install the Jupyter Notebook using:</p>
                {% highlight bash %}pip3 install jupyter{% endhighlight %}
                <p>(If you are running Python 2, change the <code>pip3</code> in these commands to <code>pip</code>.)</p>
                <p>Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook! To run the notebook, run the following command at 
                        the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows): {% highlight bash %}jupyter notebook{% endhighlight %}
                <p>
                <p>See <a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running">Running the Notebook</a> for more details.</p>
